<h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR: </strong>In the following, you will find an overview
  of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in
  addition to the regulations of the GDPR, national data protection requirements may apply in your
  or our country of residence or domicile. If, in individual cases, more specific legal bases are
  relevant, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their
    consent to the processing of personal data concerning them for a specific purpose or several
    specific purposes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b) GDPR)</strong
    >
    - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party
    or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is
    necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third
    party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
    freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data
  protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This
  includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing
  (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). The BDSG contains in particular special regulations on the
  right to information, the right to deletion, the right of objection, the processing of special
  categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission as well as automated
  decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws
  of the individual federal states may apply.
</p>

<h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
<p>
  We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal
  requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature,
  scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of
  occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a
  level of protection appropriate to the risk.
</p>
<p>
  The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
  data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input,
  transmission, securing availability and their separation. Furthermore, we have established
  procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and reactions to
  data hazards. Furthermore, we consider the protection of personal data already during the
  development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of
  data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.
</p>
<p>
  Securing online connections through TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data of
  users transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption
  technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of
  secure data transmission on the Internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted
  between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), protecting the data
  from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all
  data transmissions meet the highest security standards. If a website is secured by an SSL/TLS
  certificate, this is signaled by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator for
  users that their data is transmitted securely and encrypted.
</p>
<p>
  Website security with HTTP Security Headers:
  <br />
  Security Headers are HTTP headers sent by the web server that control the security of the browser.
</p>
<p>
  TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is a method for two-factor authentication (2FA) that increases
  the security of online accounts by generating a time-limited one-time code (usually valid for 30
  seconds) in addition to the password, often via an authenticator app on the smartphone, to create
  a second security factor. This code is generated by a shared secret key and the current time,
  making it different with every login and warding off attackers who only know the password.
</p>
<p>
  The user password is not saved. Instead, a password hash is used, which is generated from the
  password:
  <br />
  Argon2id is a modern, memory-intensive password hashing function and Key Derivation Function (KDF)
  developed as a hybrid of the Argon2d and Argon2i variants to ensure strong resistance against
  various types of attacks such as GPU cracking and side-channel attacks, and is considered a proven
  standard for the secure storage of passwords as it offers configurable parameters for memory, time
  and parallelism and was standardized in RFC 9106.
</p>
<p>
  Mail delivery takes place exclusively via an authenticated system account via TLS v1.2.
  <br />
  The mail provider used is netcup GmbH.

<h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
<p>
  We delete personal data that we process in accordance with the legal provisions as soon as the
  underlying consents are revoked or there are no further legal grounds for the processing. This
  applies to cases where the original processing purpose no longer applies or the data is no longer
  needed. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer
  retention or archiving of the data.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, data that must be kept for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is
  necessary for legal prosecution or for the protection of the rights of other natural or legal
  persons must be archived accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  Our privacy policy contains additional information on the retention and deletion of data that
  applies specifically to certain processing operations.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of several specifications on the retention period or deletion periods of a date, the
  longest period is always decisive. Data that is no longer kept for the originally intended purpose
  but due to legal requirements or other reasons, we process exclusively for the reasons that
  justify its retention.
</p>
<p>
  Retention and deletion of data: The following general periods apply to retention and archiving
  under German law:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    10 years - Retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories,
    management reports, opening balance sheet as well as the work instructions and other
    organizational documents required for their understanding (§ 147 Para. 1 No. 1 in conjunction
    with Para. 3 AO, § 14b Para. 1 UStG, § 257 Para. 1 No. 1 in conjunction with Para. 4 HGB).
  </li>
  <li>
    8 years - Accounting vouchers, such as invoices and cost receipts (§ 147 Para. 1 No. 4 and 4a in
    conjunction with Para. 3 Sentence 1 AO as well as § 257 Para. 1 No. 4 in conjunction with Para.
    4 HGB).
  </li>
  <li>
    6 years - Other business documents: received commercial or business letters, reproductions of
    the sent commercial or business letters, other documents insofar as they are of importance for
    taxation, e.g. hourly wage slips, operating accounting sheets, calculation documents, price
    markings, but also payroll accounting documents insofar as they are not already accounting
    vouchers and cash register strips (§ 147 Para. 1 No. 2, 3, 5 in conjunction with Para. 3 AO, §
    257 Para. 1 No. 2 and 3 in conjunction with Para. 4 HGB).
  </li>
  <li>
    3 years - Data required to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar
    contractual claims and rights as well as to process related inquiries, based on previous
    business experiences and common industry practices, are stored for the duration of the regular
    statutory limitation period of three years (§§ 195, 199 BGB).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Start of the period at the end of the year: If a period does not expressly begin on a specific
  date and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in which
  the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the
  context of which data is stored, the event triggering the period is the time at which the
  termination or other end of the legal relationship becomes effective.
</p>

<h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
<p>
  Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: As a data subject, you have various rights under the GDPR,

      provisions. If personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you
      have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the
      purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such
      direct advertising.</strong

<h2 id="m17">Newsletter and Electronic Notifications</h2>
<p>
  We send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter "newsletter") only
  with the consent of the recipient or on the basis of a legal basis. If the contents of the
  newsletter are specifically described as part of the registration for the newsletter, they are
  decisive for the consent of the users. For the registration to our newsletter, the provision of
  your email address is usually sufficient. However, in order to be able to offer you a personalized
  service, we may ask for your name for a personal address in the newsletter or for further
  information if this is necessary for the purpose of the newsletter.
</p>
<p>
  Deletion and restriction of processing: We can store the unsubscribed email addresses for up to
  three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to be able to
  prove a previously given consent. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a
  potential defense against claims. An individual deletion request is possible at any time, provided
  that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case of obligations
  to permanently observe objections, we reserve the right to store the email address solely for this
  purpose in a blocklist.
</p>
<p>
  The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for
  the purpose of proving its proper course. Insofar as we commission a service provider with the
  sending of emails, this takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and
  secure sending system.
