## 🛠️ For Administrators (The Technical Stuff)

_This section is for the person hosting the app._

CakePlanner is built with performance and modern standards in mind:

- **Backend:** Modern **Qt6 C++23** using the [Crow](https://crowcpp.org/) framework.
- **Database:** SQLite3 (Lightweight and fast).
- **Image Processing:** Qt6-based image optimization (Automatic WebP conversion for fast loading times).

### Admin-Panel

> \[!NOTE]
> The Admin-Panel is currently rudimentary implemented (user management works stable, group-mgmt. still under construction)
