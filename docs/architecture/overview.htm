<h2>1. System Context (The Big Picture)</h2>

<p>
  CakePlanner is designed as a monolithic application that serves baking groups (companies, clubs,
  friends) to organize events. It acts as the central hub for planning, rating, and sharing photos.
</p>

<h2>2. Container Architecture</h2>

<p>
  The system consists of a modern Single Page Application (SPA) frontend and a high-performance C++
  backend.

<h2>3. Domain Design (Bounded Contexts)</h2>

<p>
  To keep the logic organized, the application is conceptually divided into distinct Bounded
  Contexts. Each context handles a specific part of the business domain.

<h3>🔎 Context Descriptions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Identity & Access</strong>: Handles user registration, login, and group assignments.
      Ensures that only group members can see their events.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Planning</strong>: The core calendar logic. Manages dates, baker assignments, and
      prevents scheduling conflicts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Engagement</strong>: Contains the logic for the "Hall of Fame". It calculates average
      ratings and sorts events by popularity.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Media</strong>: A specialized technical context responsible for handling file uploads,
      generating thumbnails, and optimizing images for the web (WebP).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Administration</strong>: Provides tools for system maintainers to manage users, reset
      passwords, configure global settings, and view system logs.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
