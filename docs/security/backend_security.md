## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

The application uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication.

- **Library**: `token_utils.hpp` handles token generation and verification.
- **Structure**: Tokens contain a payload with the User ID, Email, and Roles (Admin/User).
- **Transport**: Tokens must be sent in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>`.
- **Validation**:
  - The `AuthMiddleware` verifies the token signature on every protected request.
  - Expired or tampered tokens result in `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Middleware**: `AuthMiddleware` injects the current user context into the request.
- **Controllers**: Individual controllers (e.g., `AdminController`) check `user.is_admin` to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.

## 2. Password Security

User passwords are **never** stored in plain text.

### Hashing Algorithm: Argon2id

The application uses **Argon2id**, the winner of the Password Hashing Competition (PHC) and currently recommended by OWASP.

- **Implementation**: `src/utils/password_utils.cpp`
- **Parameters**:
  - **T-Cost (Iterations)**: 3
  - **M-Cost (Memory)**: 64 MB (Hardens against GPU/ASIC attacks)
  - **Parallelism**: 4 Threads
  - **Salt**: 16 Bytes random salt generated per password.
  - **Hash Length**: 32 Bytes.

## 3. Data Protection

### SQL Injection Prevention

All database interactions via `DatabaseManager` and Models use **Prepared Statements** (via `QSqlQuery`).

- **Mechanism**: Inputs are bound using `bindValue()` (e.g., `:email`, `:id`) instead of string concatenation.
- **Benefit**: This effectively neutralizes SQL injection attacks.

### Input Validation

- **Strong Typing**: The use of C++ struct models (`User`, `Event`) ensures data types are respected.
- **Crow Routing**: Route parameters are typed (e.g., `<string>`, `<int>`), preventing basic malformed URL attacks.

## 4. Transport Security

### HTTPS / TLS

The Crow server runs on **HTTP** internally (default port 8080).

- **Recommendation**: For production, **ALWAYS** sit the application behind a Reverse Proxy (Nginx, Apache, Traefik).
- **SSL Termination**: The reverse proxy should handle SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS) and forward requests to the backend via localhost.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- The application implements CORS handling in middleware to allow requests from the frontend application.
- **Preflight Checks**: `OPTIONS` requests are handled globally to support browser preflight checks.

## 5. Security Best Practices

- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**: The backend supports TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) for an additional layer of login security (`totp_utils.hpp`).
- **Rate Limiting**: Currently not implemented in the application layer. It is recommended to configure Rate Limiting on the **Reverse Proxy** level (e.g., `limit_req` in Nginx) to prevent Brute Force or DDoS attacks.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive secrets (Database path, API keys, SMTP credentials) are loaded from `.env` and **not** hardcoded.
